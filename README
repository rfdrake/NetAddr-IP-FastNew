NAME

    NetAddr::IP::FastNew - NetAddr::IP new() methods with no validation

VERSION

    0.4

SYNOPSIS

        use NetAddr::IP::FastNew;
    
        my $ip = new NetAddr::IP::FastNew( '10.10.10.5' );

DESCRIPTION

    This module is designed to quickly create NetAddr::IP objects.

    If you have a situation where you need 200_000 NetAddr::IP objects then
    the initialization speed can really become a problem.

METHODS

 new

    Right now this just calls NetAddr::IP->new().

       my $ip = NetAddr::IP::FastNew->new("127.0.0.1");

 new_ipv4

    Create a real NetAddr::IP from a single IPv4 address with almost no
    validation.

    This only takes one argument, the single IP address. Anything else will
    fail in (probably) bad ways. Validation is completely up to you and is
    not done here.

       my $ip = NetAddr::IP::FastNew->new_ipv4("127.0.0.1");

 new_ipv4_mask

    Create a real NetAddr::IP from a IPv4 subnet with almost no validation.

    This requires the IP address and the subnet mask as it's two arguments.
    Anything else will fail in (probably) bad ways. Validation is
    completely up to the caller is not done here.

       my $ip = NetAddr::IP::FastNew->new_ipv4_mask("127.0.0.0", "255.255.255.0");

 new_ipv4_cidr

    Create a real NetAddr::IP object from a IPv4 cidr with almost no
    validation.

    This requires the IP address and the cidr in a single argument.
    Anything else will fail in (probably) bad ways. Validation is
    completely up to the caller is not done here.

       my $ip = NetAddr::IP::FastNew->new_ipv4_cidr("127.0.0.0/24");

 new_ipv6

    Create a real NetAddr::IP object from an IPv6 subnet with no
    validation. This is almost as fast as the lazy object. The only caveat
    being it requires a cidr mask.

       my $ip = NetAddr::IP::FastNew->new_ipv6("fe80::/64");
